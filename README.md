A relatively light (<1000 LOC) format similar to JSON, except with the addition of embedded property types in values.

#### The project is currently under development; major changes are to be expected between versions. A production-ready release is on the horizon, but for now the project will remain alpha until the source code is in a simpler, more elegant state, and with key functionalities implemented. If you find a bug during usage, please create an issue with an object to replicate the error.
